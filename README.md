### an introduction about yourself ###
Hi, I'm **Mohammad**, a *civil engineer* who is currently trying to shift my career into web development. I've always been passionate about technology and I'm excited to explore the world of coding and learn new programming languages and frameworks to improve my skills.

Aside from coding, I love powerlifting. There's something incredibly satisfying about pushing my physical limits and seeing progress in my strength training. Whether I'm coding or in the gym, I always bring my dedication and determination to everything I do.
