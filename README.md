### an introduction about yourself ###
Hi, I'm **Mohammad**, a *civil engineer* who is currently trying to shift my career into web development. I've always been passionate about technology and I'm excited to explore the world of coding and learn new programming languages and frameworks to improve my skills.

Aside from coding, I love powerlifting. There's something incredibly satisfying about pushing my physical limits and seeing progress in my strength training. Whether I'm coding or in the gym, I always bring my dedication and determination to everything I do.

## what we learned from todays lecture ##
We learned what version control systems (VCS) are and how to work with projects in both remote and local repositories. We also learned how to handle our projects after making modifications and upload them to our remote repository. This included learning how to use the command line and exploring a few basic commands, with references provided to expand our knowledge on the topic. In addition, we briefly looked at the Markdown language and its syntax, and were provided with the necessary references to use it.
